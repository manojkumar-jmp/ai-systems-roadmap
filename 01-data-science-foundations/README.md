# Data Science Foundations

This module covers the **data foundation layer** of AI systems.
The focus is on **data quality, understanding, and feature preparation**, not modeling.

## Objectives
- Understand raw data and business signals
- Clean, validate, and transform datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Prepare features for downstream ML systems

## Scope
- Data cleaning & normalization
- Handling missing and inconsistent data
- Statistical summaries
- Feature engineering

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SQL (conceptual)

## What This Is NOT
- Not dashboard-heavy analytics
- Not visualization-first data science
- Not production ML

## Outcome
Reusable, well-defined datasets and features that can be reliably consumed by ML and AI systems.
