# Machine Learning Systems (Structured Data)

This module focuses on **classical machine learning models** and how they are
developed, evaluated, and prepared for production use.

## Objectives
- Build predictive models using structured data
- Apply consistent evaluation practices
- Understand trade-offs between model types
- Package models for deployment

## Covered Topics
- Regression & classification
- Tree-based models
- Feature selection
- Model evaluation & validation
- Scikit-learn pipelines

## Tools & Technologies
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Python

## Architectural Focus
- Reproducible training
- Clear separation between data prep and modeling
- Model artifacts suitable for registries

## Outcome
Production-ready ML models that can be deployed via APIs or batch pipelines.
