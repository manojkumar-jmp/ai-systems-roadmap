# AI Systems Engineering Roadmap (Senior Software Engineer Track)

This repository documents a **career-oriented transition into Artificial Intelligence**,
designed specifically for **experienced software engineers**.

The focus is **Applied AI / Generative AI systems**, not academic research or isolated models.

---

## Guiding Principle

> **AI careers progress by increasing system ownership, not by learning more algorithms.**

Models are components.  
Systems are the product.

## AI Landscape: Career + Architecture View

(Insert Career + Architecture Mermaid Diagram here)

This diagram shows:
- How business problems flow into AI systems
- How responsibilities increase across layers
- Why senior engineers naturally gravitate toward system-level roles

## Role Progression

| Layer | Focus | Typical Roles |
|----|----|----|
| Data Science | Insights & experimentation | Data Analyst, Data Scientist |
| Machine Learning | Model development | ML Engineer |
| Applied GenAI | Model + system integration | Applied AI / GenAI Engineer |
| AI Systems & MLOps | Reliability & scale | Senior ML Engineer, AI Architect |

## Fastest Transition Path (Senior Engineers)
Senior Software Engineer
- Applied AI / GenAI Engineer
- Senior ML / AI Systems Engineer
- AI Architect / Principal Engineer

This path:
- Leverages system design experience
- Minimizes unnecessary math-heavy detours
- Matches enterprise hiring patterns

---

## System Architectures

This repository emphasizes **production-grade AI architectures**, including:

- Traditional ML systems
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Enterprise GenAI platforms
- MLOps and lifecycle automation
