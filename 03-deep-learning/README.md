- Learn why transformers power modern LLMs
- Build simple deep learning models
- Perform inference safely and predictably

## Covered Topics
- Neural network fundamentals
- Transformers (high-level)
- Model training vs inference
- Overfitting and generalization

## Tools & Technologies
- PyTorch
- Python

## What This Is NOT
- Not computer vision research
- Not hyperparameter optimization
- Not academic benchmarking

## Outcome
Confidence in working with neural models as **components within larger systems**.
